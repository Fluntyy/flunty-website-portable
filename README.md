# Flunty's Website Portable
A portable version of my website. It's completely useless, but hey, at least itâ€™s portable! ðŸŽ‰

## Prebuilt ISO
No need to break a sweat building it yourselfâ€”just grab the prebuilt ISO and let it do all the heavy lifting for you.

1. **Download the prebuilt ISO**: [Latest Release](https://github.com/Fluntyy/flunty-website-portable/releases/latest)
2. **Burn the ISO**: 
    - Burn it to a USB drive or DVD. (Or just double-click the ISO file, no DVD-burning wizardry required.)
3. **Run the Website**: 
    - Open **Explorer** and double-click the `Flunty's Website Portable` folder. (Itâ€™s magic!)
    - The server will start running on port 3000. (Don't worry, it wonâ€™t bite.)
4. **That's it!** Just sit back, relax, and pretend it's the most useful thing you've ever done.

## Build it Yourself (Recommended)
If youâ€™re feeling adventurous and want to see how the sausage is made, go ahead and build it yourself! Itâ€™s more fun, and youâ€™ll get the freshest, hottest version of Fluntyâ€™s Website and Node.js.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:
- **An internet connection** (unless youâ€™re a wizard, in which case... teach me your ways)
- **A Windows machine** (Sorry, Mac and Linux users, youâ€™ll have to just enjoy the website)
- **Python** (v3.6+)
- **Node.js** (for building the website)
- **Git**

### Requirements
- `requests` 

(Just run `pip install requests` and boom, you're good to go)

### Steps

1. **Run the Builder Script**:  
    Open a terminal and run the Python builder script.
    ```bash
    python builder.py
    ```

2. **Pick Your Node.js Version**:  
    The script will ask for the Node.js version you want. It has to be **LTS** (Long Term Support) because thatâ€™s the only version that still remembers what 32-bit systems are. If you're unsure, just hit enter to go with the default version (`22.13.1`).
    ```
    Which Node.js version would you like to use? (LTS only, default 22.13.1):
    ```

3. **Let the Magic Happen**:  
    Wait for the script to work its wizardry. Once itâ€™s done, itâ€™ll generate a shiny new `flunty-website-portable.iso` in your current directory.

4. **Burn the ISO**:  
    Now you can burn the ISO onto a USB or DVD (or just mount it and marvel at your creation).

Now, you've got a portable website that may or may not change the world (but at least it looks cool). Happy coding, and remember: If you donâ€™t build it, itâ€™s just a fancy flash drive. ðŸ˜Ž
